# Restaurant Guest Book Mini Project

Small console demo app that imitates restaurant guest book registrator.

General workflow:
1. Ask a user for their name and how many there are in their party
2. Save the name of the party and the number of people in it
3. Update the total number of guests
4. Keep going until all the guests are in
5. Print out list of parties (Name, Number of people - format), and the total amount of guests
